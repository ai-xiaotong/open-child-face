# OpenChildFace Dataset

Currently, commercial face recognition systems can reach extraordinarily high performance for adult data.
However, when turning to child data, most of them achieve much poor performance.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of low-age face recognition,
we release a child sub-dataset `OpenChildFace`, extracted from glint-asian and glint-msra,
including 45 ids and 784 images.

The dataset can be downloaded from
